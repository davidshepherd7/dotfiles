Basically there are two reasons why I'm using `urxvt` (`rxvt-unicode` is the package name in debian etc.):\r\n\r\n* It is configured by a simple text file\r\n\r\n    This means when I set up a new system (or, more likely, install a new\r\n    version of linux) all I need to do to get things set up is copy a file into\r\n    `~/`. While terminal settings are not really a big deal (pretty colours\r\n    mostly...) it's much easier than all the clicking through menus needed to\r\n    set up something like `mate-terminal`.\r\n\r\n* It works on any linux distribution\r\n\r\n    Pretty self explanatory really. If I decide at some point to drop\r\n    gnome-based linux distributions (which I nearly did a few months ago) I\r\n    don't want to have to find new versions of various programs.\r\n\r\n* It supports unicode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are plenty of terminal emulators which fufil these two criteria, however I'd heard (well, read) good things about urxvt so I gave it a try.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe setup\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above there's not really all that much to configure here. However there are some nasty little gotchas in the file syntax.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
