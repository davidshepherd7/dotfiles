# When we want to modify how a hook works or to disable it, we
# can send environment variables that the hooks can read. The
# environment variables are prepended with HG_USERVAR_ and are thus
# not a security vulnerability. For example:
#
# hg push --pushvars="BYPASS_REVIEWERS=true" --pushvars="DEBUG=1"
#
# will result in both HG_USERVAR_BYPASS_REVIEWERS and HG_USERVAR_DEBUG
# available to the hook environment.
