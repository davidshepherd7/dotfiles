How to run Facebook experimental extensions tests
=================================================

Running the tests
-----------------

To run the tests, `cd` into this directory (./tests/) and run the `run-tests.py`
script from the core Mercurial repository (tests directory too).

For example if you have a 'hg-crew' repository checked out next to this one,
use:

  ../../hg-crew/tests/run-tests.py

Obtaining the test runners
--------------------------

If you do not already have a copy of the Mercurial repository, you can obtains
one with:

  $ hg clone http://mercurial-scm.org/hg

Running against various Mercurial versions
------------------------------------------

By default, the test runners will run against the version of Mercurial in the
repository it lives in. you can run against other version of Mercurial using
the --with-hg=PATH flag. For example to run against the installed version of
Mercurial you can use --with-hg=`which hg`
